# Machine-Learning

The project involves investigating the heart disease dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sumaiyatasmeem/heart-disease-classification-dataset. The data set is cleaned and EDA is performed. Further classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest and KNeighbors classifier are used for training of the models. The evaluation metrics are calculated. Hyperparameter tuning is done to improve the accuracy of the models. The methods used for tuning include RandomizedSearchCV and GridSearchCV. Further cross-validation is also used for improving the model performance. The ROC curve gives good results with a AUC value of 0.91. The problem can be further investigated using different classification algorithms such as CatBoost or XgBoost.
