The project includes the use of linear regression, Random Forest Regressor and Decison Tree Regressor for developing ML models in studying the California House Prices Dataset which is taken form Kaggle.com. The missing values occupy a small portion and were removed. The EDA is performed for understanding the data and drawing useful insights. The heatmap and scatterplot are used for this purpose using the Seaborn visualization library. Random Forest Regressor gave the best score with a value of 0.82. The dataset is taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/camnugent/california-housing-prices.
