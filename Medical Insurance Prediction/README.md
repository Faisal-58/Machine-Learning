The project involves analyzing the insurance dataset taken from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance. The dataset is fairly cleaned as it does not consists of any missing or duplicated values. The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed on the dataset and useful insights are drawn. The data consists of overweight people having high values of BMI then normal or healthy person. The insurance price is predicted using the regression techniques. The techniques used include linear regression and random forest regressor. The random forest regressor gives a good score as compared to linear regression. The r2 values for linear regression are also calculated for the training and testing data. At the end, the value of charges is predicted using the random forest regressor model showing good results.
